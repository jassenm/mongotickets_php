The team made it to their first AFL championship game in 1963, where they lost to the San Diego Chargers.  1963 would mark the only time that decade the Patriots could make it to a championship, but they made up for their dismal showing by the mid-1970s, when the team consistently putting out winning seasons for the next few years.  Although the New England Patriots did not win the Super Bowl until 2002, they often brought home the AFL championships, but were defeated in early games during post-season play.  In 2002, the team was viewed as the underdog in the Super Bowl game against St. Louis Rams, but managed to pull out a stunning win that would finally prove to fans that the New England Patriots were one of the NFL’s strongest teams at the start of the new millennium. </p><p>After losing to the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC championship in the 2006 season, the New England Patriots made it to the Super Bowl championship with a stunning 18-0 record in 2007.

New York Giants,599,"The New York Giants will be giving lucky ticket-holders a stomping good time as they attempt to bulldoze through the competition and make their way toward another Super Bowl title.   The 2007 season saw the Giants improving on this disappointing 2006 season, with a 10-6 record and just enough talent to squeak into the playoffs as a wild card.  The New York giants went on to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Green Bay Packers to win the NFC championship and make their way to the Super Bowl, making the Giants only the ninth team in NFL history to win a place in the Super Bowl after starting as a wild card.

<p>Businessman and bookmaker Tim Mara created the New York Giants in 1925, hoping to bring professional football out of the shadow of baseball, boxing, and other major sports by bringing an NFL team to the popular city of New York.   The team managed its first championship in only its third season, but the substantial losses Mara faced in the 1927 stock market crash and the ensuing Depression threatened the New York Giants’ future.  The team’s perseverance helped them through tough times during both the Depression and World War II, when the team lost many of its star players to the military.  Despite those losses, the New York Giants still managed to bring three championship titles to New York during the 1940s.</p><br/>

Arizona Diamondbacks,41,"The Diamondbacks are hoping their 2008 season will be another winner.  General manager Bob Melvin is hoping that the Diamondbacks’ young lineup will give them an advantage over other major league teams, and with talent like shortstop Stephen Drew, outfielders Carlos Quentin and Chris Young, as well as former White Sox player Jose Vazquez and second baseman Orlando Hudson, fans will not be disappointed.  Arizona Diamondbacks games at Chase Field, and across the country, are sure to delight fans young and old! ","<p>The Arizona Diamondbacks are the first professional baseball team for the state, and, since their debut at Chase Field in 1998, the Arizona Diamondbacks have been gaining popularity with professional baseball fans around the country.  The team may have had a disappointing first season in 1998, but made up for that disappointment by winning the National League West Division Title.  Although they were defeated in the first round of the division playoffs by the New York Mets, winning the National League West Title certainly made fans sit up and take notice of the new team on the block.  Tickets to Arizona Diamondback games soon became one of the hottest tickets in town, with fans turning up to take in Diamondback games at Chase Field and other baseball venues around the country.</p><br/>
<p>The Arizona Diamondbacks’ 2000 season may have been another disappointment for fans, but in 2001 the team’s star players turned on the heat and captured their second Division Title.  The Diamondbacks, with the help of players like Luis Gonzales, Curt Schilling, and Randy Johnson, made it to the World Series in 2001, where they faced off against the New York Yankees in a nail-biting seven-game series that was one of the most watched in major league baseball history.

Atlanta Braves,50,"The team is hoping to bring home another division title, and maybe even play in the World Series once again, for their 2008 season.  Despite breaking their division title winning streak in 2007 with a disappointing season, the team is hoping to make a strong showing in regular and post-season play.  Braves general manager John Schuerholz is focusing on improving the Atlanta Braves’ pitching staff for the 2008 season, bringing in Rafael Soriano from the Mariners and Mike Gonzalez from the Pirates, as well as relying on the team’s star players, including John Smoltz, Bob Wickman, and Tom Hudson.  Atlanta Braves games at Turner Field are sure to be exciting for fans and the players as the team tries to get back on the winning side and bring World Series glory to Atlanta once again. ","<p>Over the last few years, the Atlanta Braves have been one of the most successful teams in major league baseball during regular season.  Atlanta Braves games at Turner Field entice fans young and old, who come to watch their favorite team and players create baseball magic.  But, despite their strong showing in regular season, the team has only managed to pull out three championships in their history, in 1914, 1957, and 1995.  The team boasts a record twelve post-season appearances from 1991 to 2003, but with only one World Series win to show for their efforts.  The 1995 season was the team’s most memorable though, with the Atlanta Braves finally winning the World Series, defeating the Cleveland Indians 4-2.
</p><br/>
<p>Since their 1995 World Series wins, the Atlanta Braves have appeared in post-season play in seven seasons, but failed to bring home another Series win.  Despite their lack of World Series titles, tickets to Atlanta Braves games, both at their home stadium of Turner Field and at other major league baseball venues around the country, are a hot commodity, with fans showing up in droves to cheer on their favorite players.</p>",
Colorado Rockies,193,"Their young stars took them to the 2007 World Series thanks to players like Jeff Francis, Todd Helton, Matt Holliday, and Willy Taveras, as well as the high altitude in Denver, the team is hoping to get to the pennant again this year.  The young staff and their drive for a championship are sure to make Colorado Rockies games at Coors Field, and at other baseball venues across the country a huge draw for fans, who are waiting for their team to take their place in major league baseball history.  ","<p>The Colorado Rockies certainly haven’t made baseball history since their formation in 1993, but that doesn’t mean the team lacks the heart or the fans needed to make them a sports staple in the city of Denver!  Fans enjoy taking in Colorado Rockies games at Coors Field, no matter who the team is facing off against, and each year, they hold their breath, hoping it might be the team’s year to bring home a pennant. </p>",
Texas Rangers,853,"After their 2006 record of 80-82 and third place ranking in the American League West, fans are hopeful that the team might finally pull a winning season out of their hat.  Texas Rangers games at their home ballpark and at other baseball venues across the country are sure to be a big draw in 2007.  New manager Ron Washington is pinning his pennant hopes on players such as Hank Blalock, Mark Teixeira, and Michael Young.  And of course, with Sammy Sosa now playing for the Texas Rangers, Washington, and Texas Rangers fans, are hoping the baseball legend will perform as well as he did during his glory days with the Chicago Cubs.  If the team can pull together in time, they may have a chance of producing a winning season, giving fans reason to cheer for the team once again! ","<p>The Texas Rangers, originally the Washington Senators, made their debut in Texas in 1972.  Until 2002, the Rangers’ greatest claim to fame was that they were the longest running American League franchise to not win a pennant.   But, in 2002, that all changed when the Rangers won their first division title.  Although the team has never advanced to a World Series win, they have won the American League West division three times in their history.

<p>But, long-standing fans of the team still turn out to cheer their favorite players on at Texas Rangers games at The Ballpark in Arlington.

Even though the team couldn’t keep their star players for long, they did lend credibility to the team and give fans some hope that a World Series title might be in their future.</p>",Images/texas_rangers_tickets.jpg
Cincinnati Reds,173,"Due to their past successes, fans still turn out in droves to take in Cincinnati Reds games at Great American Ball Park, and at other baseball venues across the country.  Fans of all ages look forward to watching their favorite players strive to make baseball history again.   In 2007, the team is relying on its solid pitching staff and good defense.  Fans may have pinned their hopes on Ken Griffey Jr. for bringing another pennant to Cincinnati, but his countless injuries and frequent appearances on the Disabled List are frustrating fans, as well as fellow teammates.  But, with solid players like Adam Dunn, Kyle Lohse, Bronson Arroyo, and Aaron Harang rounding out the Cincinnati Reds’ roster, the team should make a strong showing for the 2007 season, enticing fans to spend time at the ballpark, taking in a Cincinnati Reds game and falling in love with America’s favorite pastime all over again!","<p>The Cincinnati Reds, originally the Cincinnati Red Legs, were major league baseball’s first franchise.  The original team traveled the Midwest as early as 1878, beating nearly every team they encountered.  Though the twentieth-century Reds aren’t quite as successful, they still boast five World Series titles, in 1919, 1940, 1975, 1976, and 1990, as well as four National League Pennants.  But, without a doubt, the team’s most notorious World Series title was the 1919 series, where the team faced off against the Chicago White Sox.  Eight White Sox players were later banned from professional baseball for intentionally losing the series.  Who knows if the Reds would have won the series on their own, but their inadvertent involvement in the tainted series has made them part of baseball’s darker  history.   In the 1970s, the team made history for a more positive reason, becoming the first National League team to win back-to-back World Series since the 1922 Giants.</p>",
Kansas City Royals,428,"Fans hope the 2008 season will be one of the best in recent Royals’ history, thanks in large part to General Manager Dayton Moore’s efforts to acquire a stellar pitching staff, which he rounded out with Gil Meche and Octavio Dotel.   With the team ranking last in the AL Central division four of the last five years, the team needs to step up and show their fans they are still a team worth rooting for.  Moore is counting on Angel Berroa, Mike Sweeney, and Zack Greinke to bring the team back to the top of the division and fans are sure to show up at Kansas City Royal games to watch the players battle their way to the top of the rankings. ","<p>The Kansas City Royals are viewed as one of the most successful expansion teams in baseball history, with winning records for fourteen of their nineteen seasons between 1971 and 1989, as well as six division titles, two pennant wins, and a World Series Title from 1976 to 1985.  Many attribute the team’s success during this time to Hall of Famer George Brett.  Their bitter rivalry with the New York Yankees during those years also helped motivate the players and inspire their fans to show up at root the team on.
</p><br/>
<p>In 1980, thanks to the high-powered batting of George Brett, the Kansas City Royals won their first pennant, but were defeated in the World Series by the Phillies, a defeat most Royals fans are still trying to recover from.  Then, in 1985, the Royals finally won a World Series title by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals.  However, after George Brett retired in 1993, the Royals’ record took a nose dive the team is still struggling to recover from.   But, despite their poor rankings the last few years, Kansas City Royals games, both at their home field of Kauffman Stadium and at other baseball venues around the country, are a huge hit with fans, who show up to cheer their favorite players on and dream of another pennant win.</p>",
Minnesota Twins,554,"As the 2008 season approaches, the Twins are hoping to defend their fourth AL Central title, relying on the skills of players such as Joe Mauer, Justin Morneau, and Luis Castillo.   Minnesota Twins games are a huge draw at their home field and across the country as their fans dream of another win, and maybe, in the not so distant future, a World Series title. ","<p>The Minnesota Twins, originally the Washington Senators, have perhaps one of the rockiest records in major league baseball history.   As the Senators, the team came in last more than ten times in their early history, and in the bottom 7 and additional twenty-three times.  Despite their dismal record, the Senators did manage to win three pennants, in 1924, 1925, and 1933, as well as winning the World Series in 1925. </p><br/>
<p>Once they became the Minnesota Twins, in 1961, the team’s luck seemed to change, with the new Twins winning pennants, division titles, and coming in as a top five team numerous times over the next few years.  As the team rebuilt itself through the 1960s, they acquired legendary players that brought the team to the top of the MLB.   Minnesota Twins games drew fans around the country as they watched their favorite players bring home wins and reminded baseball fans why they truly love the game.  
</p><br/>
<p>At their home field, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the Minnesota Twins consistently deliver action-packed games, as well as delivering exciting World Series performances in 1987 and 1991, when the team won every one of its home games in the Series playing against the Detroit Tigers and the Atlanta Braves.  But, the rest of the 1990s proved to be a dismal decade for the team as they fell farther back in the rankings, causing Minnesota Twins fans to wonder if they would ever see their team in the playoffs again.  Finally, in 2003, Twins fans were rewarded with their team earning a spot in the playoffs, where they won a second straight AL Central title before losing to the Yankees in the playoffs. </p>",Images/minnesota_twins_tickets.jpg
Cleveland Indians,183,"After a disappointing 2007 season, the Cleveland Indians are hoping to bounce back in 2008, relying on the skills of top players like Grady Sizemore, Josh Barfield, David Dellucci, and Trot Nixon.   With their strengthened bullpen and competent coaching staff, the Cleveland Indians may just be able to surprise their fans and put out a stellar performance this season, making this summer’s Cleveland Indian’s season one of the best in recent years! ","<p>The Cleveland Indians baseball team is one of major league baseball’s most legendary franchises.  As one of only four franchises that have remained in the same city for over one hundred years, the Indians are a fixture in Cleveland, and in baseball history.  The 1954 Indians team is considered by experts and fans alike to be one of the best in baseball history, winning a league record 111 games thanks to Hall of Fame pitchers Bob Feller, Bob Lemon, and Early Wynn.   In 1948, the team managed to win the series pennant under manager Lou Boudreau, who made the Indians one of the strongest teams in the majors for the next few years.  Although the Cleveland Indians managed to win every American League Central title from 1995 to 1999, but the World Series title still eluded the team, much to the coaching staff, and fans’, disappointment.  </p><br/>
<p>But a lack of World Series wins hasn’t caused the team’s popularity to falter.  Thanks to the Cleveland Indian’s new stadium at Jacob’s Field, built in 1994 and touted as one of baseball’s most fan-friendly parks, Cleveland Indian games are selling out across the country.   Fans turn up in droves at Cleveland Indian home games, as well as face-offs with other teams at baseball venues across the country, to root for their team and their favorite players, making the Cleveland Indians one of major league baseball’s most lucrative franchises.   As younger generations of fans are introduced to the Indians’ lineup, they are realizing that, despite the team’s lack of titles, the team is one worth watching, inspiring baseball fans to open their wallets and pay top dollar for tickets to Cleveland Indians games at Jacob’s Field and at other major league baseball fields, where they can witness their team’s strong players try to make history once again. </p>",Images/cleveland_indians_tickets.jpg
New York Yankees,607,"In the Yankees’ 2007 season, the team hopes to end a World Series drought and bring the title back to New York, and it is up to manager Joe Torre to deliver a winning line up.  Torre is relying on superstar Alex Rodriguez to bring in the wins, as well as Kei Igawa out of Japan, Andy Pettite, and Chien-Ming Wang.  As the Yankees strive to win their tenth straight American League East title, fan are coming out in droves to root their team to victory and watch them try to make more major league history.   ","<p>The New York Yankees are known as one of the most successful teams in major league baseball.  Since their beginnings in 1903 the Yankees have won thirty-nine American League pennants, eleven division championships, and twenty-six World Series titles, making the Yankees the most successful major league franchises in history.   Whether the team is playing at Yankee Stadium or at other baseball venues around the country, tickets to Yankee games are a hot commodity and fans are willing to pay top dollar to watch their favorite team face off with other major league baseball teams.  Ticket sales for face-offs with the Yankees’ bitter rival, the Boston Red Sox, are especially high as fans cheer for their favored team and fan the flames of a rivalry that has thrived for decades.</p><br/>
<p>Perhaps the most legendary Yankee player is Babe Ruth, who was acquired by the team in 1913 and went on to set more league records than any player in history.   Fans still talk about Babe Ruth’s 714 homers and the exploits that made him one of the more controversial figures of the 1910s and 1920s.   </p>",Images/new_york_yankees_tickets.jpg
Oakland Athletics,625,"Oakland Athletics’ games at Network Associates Coliseum are a huge draw for the team’s fans, who are hoping to cheer their team on to another World Series title, despite the team’s disappointing performance in recent years.  As the Oakland Athletics once again rebuild their lineup in the 2008 season, the team looks to their newest players to make up for the loss of superstars Frank Thomas and Barry Zito.  Joining the ranks are future Hall of Famer Mike Piazza, Gold Glove third baseman Eric Chavez,  and 2004 American League Rookie of the Year Bobby Crosby.  Fans are hoping these new stars will make up for the devastating losses the team suffered last season and are sure to turn up in droves at Oakland Athletics home and away games to cheer their team on to victory. ","<p>The Oakland Athletics are perhaps one of major league baseball’s most traveled teams, playing for cities such as Kansas City and Philadelphia before settling in Oakland.  The team has had its share of ups and downs, bringing home four dynasties as well as finishing last in thirty of its one hundred seasons.   Players such as Stuffy McInnis, Eddie Collins, Jack Barry, and Frank Baker made the team one of the best in the country during the Athletics’ first decade, leading the team to World Series wins in 1910, 1911, and 1913, before being handed a devastating Series upset by the Atlanta Braves in the 1914 World Series.  In the 1920s, the team’s strong lineup helped them face off against the legendary Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees, and won three straight pennants  from 1929 to 1931.  In the 1970s, the Oakland Athletics became only the second team, after the New York Yankees, to win three straight World Series titles.  But, after those wins, the team’s performance took a nose dive until Tony LaRussa was named manager in 1987 and rebuilt the team to its former glory.   </p>",Images/oakland_athletics_tickets.jpg
Seattle Mariners,771,"As the 2008 season unfolds, fans are pinning their hopes on manager Mike Hargrove to build the team back up after their disappointing last place finish in the 2006 Mariners season.   Hargrove has acquired key players, right fielders Jose Guillen and Jose Vidro, and is relying on the team’s stars, Ichiro Suzuki, Adrian Beltre, and Richie Sexson to come out strong and maybe even take the Mariners all the way to the pennant race!  No matter what fans expectations are, or how the team performers, Seattle Mariners games are still a great way to enjoy America’s favorite pastime. ","<p>The Seattle Mariners arrived in Seattle on April 6, 1977, at the inaugural game of the Kingdome, which soon became Seattle’s biggest tourist attraction and helped pave the way for professional sports’ arrival in the city.  Although the Seattle Mariners now play their games at Safeco Field, the team is still one of the city’s biggest sporting franchises. 
</p><br/>
<p>Though the Seattle Mariners have had baseball greats such as Edgar Martinez, Alvin Davis, Mark Langston, and Randy Johnson, the team has never managed to bring home a championship.  But, fans still turn out for Seattle Mariners games at Safeco Field, as well as other baseball venues across the country.   Even if they aren’t rooting for the home team, baseball fans still enjoy taking in a game at the state of the art Safeco Field, which opened in 1999.  In the team’s first 3 years playing at Safeco, they managed to have the best seasons in Mariner history, giving fans hope that they may see a World Series Title in the near future.</p>",Images/seattle_mariners_tickets.jpg
Tampa Bay Rays,840,"As the 2008 Tampa Bay Devil Rays’ season begins, manager Joe Madden is pinning his hopes on a string of young players, as well as established Devil Rays, including Carl Crawford, Rocco Baldelli, Delmon Young, and Elijah Dukes.  If the team can keep their lineup strong through the season, the Devil Rays may be able to move up in the American League rankings.   Hopeful fans will show up at Devil Rays games at Tropicana Field as well as other baseball venues around the country to cheer the young team on and hope for more great baseball moments. ","<p>The Tampa Bay Devil Rays, one of the newest teams in the American League, joined the league in 1998 when the Milwaukee Brewers moved to the National League.  Though the team is still in its major league infancy, Tampa Bay Devil Rays games are still a big draw for fans hoping the team will bring a World Series title to the city.    The Tampa Bay Devil Rays boast a less than stellar record, coming in dead last in the American League for its first four seasons.
</p><br/>
<p>But, despite the franchise’s disappointing record, fans taking in Tampa Bay Devil Rays games at Tropicana Field have still witnessed great moments in baseball history.  In 1998, the Devil Rays became the first expansion team to ever be four games over .500 in their first season.  Then, on August 7, 1999, history was made once again when Wade Boggs made his 3,000th hit at Tropicana Field.

Chicago Cubs,162,"The Chicago Cubs may not be one of the most powerful or consistent teams in the NL division, but their fan base is one of the strongest and people are still lining up to get tickets to Chicago Cubs games at Wrigley Field and at other ballparks around the country, and their 2008 season promises to be better than the dismal 2007 season, when the Cubs finished last in their division.

The team has had its ups and downs throughout the years, but fans have always remained loyal and the Red Sox have featured some of the most notable names in baseball history, including Cy Young, who played for the Red Sox from 1901 to 1908, and the infamous Babe Ruth, who helped the Red Sox become World Series champions.</p>
<br/>
<p>Games are a tradition for their loyal fans, who flock to see the team and its star players, including Curt Shilling, Tim Wakefield, J.D. Drew, Manny Ramirez, and Dustin Pedroia, at their home field of Fenway Park or at other baseball fields across the country. Fenway Park has been a gold-standard in Major League baseball parks and a key part of RedSoxs history since they played their first game there in 1912. Fenway Park has hosted legendary baseball players such as Babe Ruth, Cy Young, Duffy Lewis, Ted Williams, and Jim Rice and has been the site of key moments in baseball history. Games at Fenway Park are a big seller for the team’s fans and those who want to stand within the walls of one of Major League baseball’s most famous, and long-standing, parks.</p>",Images/boston_red_sox_tickets.jpg
Chicago White Sox,164,"The 2008 Chicago White Sox season promises to be a winner as the team strives to repeat their 2005 World Series win.  The team is relying on manager Ozzie Guillen’s unique coaching methods and their new starting line-up, which features players such as Jose Contreras, Mark Buehrle, John Danks, and Bobby Jenks to bring another championship win back to Chicago.   ","<p>Chicago White Sox games at Cellular Field provide South Side fans with a chance to watch their team try to rise to the top of their American League division.  Despite a disappointing end to their 2006 season, when Sox fans were hoping the team could repeat their spectacular 2005 World Series win, fans still flock to White Sox games at their home field and at other baseball venues around the country. 
</p><br/>
<p>Their fierce rivalry with the Chicago Cubs has caused fans to take sides and root for their favorite team since the White Sox beat the favored Chicago Cubs in the 1906 World Series.  Since then, the cross-town rivalry has been going strong and shows no signs of abating, with games where the two teams face off selling more tickets than perhaps any other White Sox or Cubs game in the season.  Cheap tickets for the White Sox games sell out fast for these face-offs, as do the more expensive box seats at the White Sox’s Cellular Field.
</p><br/>
<p>The Chicago White Sox are one of the oldest franchises in the American League and have perhaps the most tainted history.  The team’s involvement in the 1919-1920 Black Sox scandal, in which Sox players Shoeless Joe Jackson, Buck Weaver, Happy Felsch, Eddie Cicotte, and four others were banned from baseball for their involvement in throwing the 1919 World Series.  Since then, the White Sox have struggled to rebuild their reputation while competing with the popular Chicago Cubs for fans.  But, diehard White Sox fans remain loyal to the team despite the team’s ups and downs and that long-ago scandal that seems to haunt the team to this day.  White Sox games and fan events are hot-sellers in Chicago and at ballparks across the country when they face off against other top-ranked teams. </p>",
Baltimore Orioles,59,"Despite the fact that the Orioles haven’t won a World Series title in more than twenty years, the team still has a strong following across the country, with fans turning up in droves at Major League Baseball venues to see what the Orioles can bring to the table.   Diehard fans are hoping that in the Oriole’s 2007 season the team can rise to the top of the AL East division, which has been dominated for years by the bitter rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox.  Manager Sam Perlozzo and pitching coach Leo Mazzone are demanding the best from their players in the hopes of bringing another American League Division championship to Baltimore.  The team is full of potential and hopeful fans are snatching up tickets to Baltimore Orioles games in the hopes of witnessing history in the making as the team builds its stamina and creates a consistent record that could bring the Orioles back into World Series favor for the first time since 1983.","<p>The Baltimore Orioles, considered the most successful team in Major League Baseball from the 1960s through the 1980s, continue to impress their fans and rivals alike.  Tickets for Baltimore Orioles games at Oriole Park at Camden Yards are still hot sellers for the regular baseball season, with fans turning out in droves to see the team’s most popular players, including Jamie Walker, Chad Bradford, Scott Williamson, and the Boston Orioles’ superstar, Miguel Tejada.   For years Cal Ripken was the Orioles heaviest hitter, and in the years since Ripken’s retirement in 2001, the team has been trying to rebuild the bullpen, bringing in strong young stars for each position, with many earning top honors in the League.     </p>",baltimore_orioles_tickets.jpg
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim,29,"Now, as the team begins their 2008 season, manager Mike Scioscia has created a top-notch team, with players such as Jered Weaver, Francisco Rodriguez, Scot Shields, and Darren Oliver, that promises to give fans another exciting ride and dreams of another division championship.  The Angels have struggled to build a solid fan base and can now boast fans who turn up in droves at baseball venues across the country to watch the Angels strong pitching staff and hard-working offensive players as they dream of a division title and another World Series win. ","<p>The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, previously known as the Anaheim Angels and the California Angels, were perhaps the least favored team in Major League Baseball until just a few years ago.  The team was considered less than mediocre for years, falling victim to poor planning, lackluster players, and little fan support, until, in the late 1990s, the team acquired a core group of players that strengthened the Angels’ bullpen and caught the notice of baseball fans.  As hopeful fans snatched up tickets for Angels games at their home field of Angel Stadium the team made a comeback that had some daring to dream of a championship win in 1995.  But, alas, the Angels’ victory was snatched away by the Seattle Mariners and, once again, the team made a dismal showing in the American League Division for the next few years. 
</p><br/>
<p>Then, in 2002, the team made a remarkable comeback, battling the Oakland A’s for the division title and winning a coveted wild card spot for the playoffs.  No one imagined the team, long viewed as the underdog of Major League Baseball, would make it through the playoffs and into the World Series, facing off against the heavily favored San Francisco Giants.  But, the Los Angeles Angels gave it their all, treating fans across the country to one of the most exciting World Series championships in history and earning top honors as the World Series champions! </p>",Images/anaheim_angels_tickets.jpg
Florida Marlins,293,"As the 2008 season approaches, Florida Marlin fans hope their team may perform well enough to earn another Wild Card spot for the playoffs, and, if they are lucky, another World Series title for their favorite team!","<p>The Florida Marlins joined the National League as an expansion team, along with the Colorado Rockies, in 1993.  Although they have one of the shortest team histories in Major League Baseball, the team has been a surprising success, with two World Series championships under their belts, which is more than some of Major League Baseball’s most established teams!  Their first World Series title was won in 1997.  The low number of fans who bought Florida Marlins tickets were pleasantly surprised when the team, thanks in large part to their new manager, Jim Leyland, managed to win a wild card spot in the playoffs and went on to win the World Series, beating out the Cleveland Indians in a dramatic, and surprising, eleventh-inning win with Edgar Renteria’s RBI-single.   Many Major League Baseball fans still consider the 1997 World Series between the Marlins and the Indians to be one of the most memorable and exciting in baseball history.  </p> 
<br/>
<p>
Unfortunately, for players and fans alike, the Florida Marlins put for a lackluster, forgettable performance from 1998 to 2002.  But, in 2003, the team once again shocked baseball fans across the country by bringing another World Series title to Florida, beating the highly favored New York Yankees in a stunning upset in game 6. </p><br/><p>
Throughout their short history, Florida Marlins games have suffered low attendance.  Many blame that fact on the team’s venue, Pro Player Stadium, which is dated and not as fan friendly as other baseball venues across the country.  But, that will all change in the near future when the team begins playing in its brand new, state-of-the-art stadium, which is slated to open in April 2010.   As a trade-off for their new stadium, the team will then change its name to the Miami Marlins.</p>",
Los Angeles Dodgers,481,"As the team gears up for the 2008 season, fans attending Los Angeles Dodgers games at Dodger Stadium are hoping that young stars like Andruw Jones and Juan Pierre can bring another division title to Los Angeles and prove the team is still one of baseball’s strongest.","<p>The Brooklyn Dodgers struggled to be noticed by New York fans, who were more loyal to the cross-town New York Giants, for the first few years of their Major League Baseball run.   But, in the 1940s the Dodgers finally gained the respect of New Yorkers and baseball fans across the country, which they enjoyed until the team was uprooted and moved to the West Coast in 1958, where they became the Los Angeles Dodgers.   
</p><br/>
<p>
Although they finished in a dismal seventh place in their first season in California, the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied in the following year to win the World Series, the first time a California franchise was ever able to win the Series title.  The Los Angeles Dodgers’ 1959 World Series win ushered in a successful decade for the team, with the Dodgers winning pennants in 1963, 1965, and 1966, and the World Series in 1963 and 1965, thanks in large part to the contributions of players Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Maury Wills, and Willie Davis.  
</p>
<br/><p>
In the 1970s, the Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds were in a constant battle for success, with the teams winning nine out of ten Western division titles.  The Dodgers took home the pennant in 1974, 1977, and 1978, but unfortunately lost all three World Series.   
</p><br/><p>
The Los Angeles Dodgers would continue to be one of Major League Baseball’s top teams in the 1980s, winning division titles again in 1983 and 1985.   In 1988, when few fans at Los Angeles Dodger games thought their team could pull off another successful World Series, the Dodgers shocked baseball fans across the country as they won the World Series in a stunning upset in 1988, beating out the favored Oakland A’s.    
 </p><br/><p>
Their success would continue into the final decade of the twentieth century, with two division titles and a wild card spot in the 1990s.

Milwaukee Brewers,549,"whether taking in a Milwaukee Brewers game at Miller Park or at other baseball venues around the country, fans are hoping to watch their team bring the pennant back to Wisconsin, and maybe even a World Series title!  With the 2008 season getting ready to start, fans and players alike are dreaming of another division title for the Brewers and will turn up to cheer on their favorite players.  ","<p>The Milwaukee Brewers were born in 1967 after the Seattle Pilots were moved east and reborn as the Milwaukee Brewers.  Bud Selig purchased the team and brought them to Wisconsin after the team’s dismal season in Seattle proved Washington was not ready to be part of Major League Baseball.  And while Wisconsin was thrilled to have baseball back in the cheese state after the loss of the Braves in 1965, the Brewers had less than stellar seasons for most of the 1970s.  But that all changed in 1977, when the team seemed to turn around, and from 1977 to 1979, the Brewers led the American League in runs scored, thanks to players like Paul Molitor, Cecil Cooper, Sal Bando, and Jim Gantner.  Although the Milwaukee Brewers were unable to make it to the playoffs, they still managed to become one of the most popular teams in Major League Baseball!  Suddenly, tickets to Milwaukee Brewers games were selling out and attendance at Milwaukee Brewers games soared. </p> 
<br/>
<p>
From 1980 to 1983, the Milwaukee Brewers boasted one of the best records in the American League.  In 1981, the team won the second-half American League East title and in 1982, they managed to bring home the division title.  But, despite their outstanding performance in the playoffs, the team lost the World Series to the Cardinals in the seventh game of the series.  However the rest of the 1980s, and the majority of the 1990s, were a series of disappointing seasons for the Milwaukee Brewers and their fans, with the team only managing to pull out a few winning seasons.  </p>
<br/>
<p>
In 1998, the team made headlines, as well as Major League Baseball history, when they became the first team in more than ninety years to switch leagues.  Now an American League team, the Brewers have managed to build their fan base, despite their lack of championships.   In 2001, the Milwaukee Brewers played their inaugural game and their new home field, Miller Park. 
</p>",
Pittsburgh Pirates,685,"As the team gears up for its 2008 season, fans attending Pittsburgh Pirates games at PNC Park hope their team can improve over its disappointing sixth place finish in 2007.  With new coaching staff and young players, fans and players are hopeful the Pirates can return to their former glory and bring home another World Series title!    ","<p>The Pittsburgh Pirates boast one of the most exciting and best teams in National League history.  Numerous Hall of Fame players have passed through the Pirates’ lineup, including Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke, Tommy Leach, and Vic Willis.  The Pittsburgh Pirates brought home their first of five World Series titles in 1909, defeating legendary player Ty Cobb and the Detroit Tigers.  1925 brought the team their second Series win, beating out the Washington Senators.  </p>  
<br/>
<p>
From the mid-1920s to 1960, the Pirates faded into Major League Baseball background, with no pennant or World Series wins.   But, that made no difference to fans, who kept turning up with their Pittsburgh Pirates tickets in order to cheer on their favorite team.  In 1960, fans’ patience was rewarded when the Pirates, thanks to a dramatic home run by Bill Mazersoki, beat the famed New York Yankees for the World Series championship.  In the 1960s, the Pirates led MLB, thanks in large part to the outstanding batting and outfielding skills of Roberto Clemente. In 1966, Clemente was voted National League Most Valuable Player after hitting 29 home runs and batting in 119 more.  Tragically, the baseball legend’s career ended prematurely after he was killed in a plane crash in 1972.  </p>
<br/>
<p>
The 1970s became the most successful decades in Pittsburgh Pirates’ history, with the team finishing first in the league six times, with two more seasons in second place, and once in third.  The Pittsburgh Pirates faced off against their leading rivals, the Cincinnati Reds, for the league pennant three times in the 1970s, although they ultimately lost each title.   </p>
<br/>
<p>
The 1980s were a decade of change for the Pirates as they were unable to repeat their stunning 1970s performance.  The team slowly began to change over their line up, replacing old favorites with new, younger players, including Barry Bonds, who went on to become one of the greatest baseball players in the last half of the twentieth century.  And, thanks in large part to Bonds’ talent, the Pirates went on to lead three more National League titles in the early 1990s, sealing their fate as one of the League’s greatest teams. </p>",
San Diego Padres,757,"In the 2008 season, fans are hopeful that the team, led by star pitcher Greg Maddux, Luis Rodriguez, Mauro Zarate, and Milton Bradley, might be able to move ahead in the National League standings and bring home another division title.  So as they cheer on the San Diego Padres at Petco Park or at other baseball venues across the country, fans will always be hopeful that their team can put forth the effort needed to make their dreams come true.  ","<p>The San Diego Padres may not be one of Major League Baseball’s oldest or most popular teams, but fan attending San Diego Padres games at Petco Park are still thrilled to watch their favorite team and its star players slug it out against baseball’s greatest teams.  </p> 
<br/>
<p>
The Padres joined MLB ranks in 1969 when they joined the National League.  Throughout the 1970s, the team struggled to build their team and failed to have even one winning season in the entire decade.  An almost move to Washington in 1973 did not do much to help the team win fans over, but, thanks to players like Nate Colbert, Cito Gaston, Johnny Grubb, Dave Winfield, Ozzie Smith, Randy Jones, Gene Richards and Gaylord Perry the team did not slip into total obscurity.  </p> 
<br/>
<p>
Finally, in 1984, the San Diego Padres managed to win the National League West division and advance to the World Series, where they faced off against the legendary Detroit Tigers.   Although the team ultimately lost the Series, they managed to win fans’ hearts and bring in more spectators for San Diego Padres games.  </p> 
<br/>
<p>
In 1998, the San Diego Padres finally managed to advance to the World Series again, where they battled against the always-strong New York Yankees.  They lost the Series to the Yankees, but still made fans proud with their division title.  Since that World Series appearance, the San Diego Padres have had no division titles, much less notable seasons.  </p>",
Detroit Tigers,241,"Detroit Tigers fans are pinning their hopes on the 2008 season. They have resigned right-handed pitchers Francisco Cruceta and Todd Jones, as well as signing All-Star shortstop Edgar Renteria from the Atlanta Braves and outfielder Jacque Jones from the Chicago Cubs.  The team’s manager and owners, as well as their loyal fans, are hoping the duo can help the team top last year’s second place American League finish.  But no matter what the team does, their fans will still turn up at Comericka Park, and baseball venues across the country, to cheer on their favorite team and keep hoping for that World Series win!","<p>The Detroit Tigers have a long, rich history in Major League Baseball.  The team posted an outstanding sixty-two winning seasons in their first one hundred seasons, and until 1989, the Detroit Tigers only came in last place three times.  From 1907 to 1909, the Tigers managed to win the division championship each year, although they never managed to pull in the World Series win, losing out to National League competitors.  1934 gave the Tigers their first World Series win, which they quickly followed with another win in the 1935 season.  </p> 
<br/>
<p>
Throughout their history, the team has also boasted some of the greatest players in Major League Baseball, including Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, Goose Goslin, Mickey Chochrane, Lou Whitaker, and Jack Morris.  Many also consider the team’s Old English “D” to be one of the most recognizable logos in sports.  </p> 
<br/>
<p>
Although the team has had disappointing seasons since the 1980s, fans still turn out in droves to watch the powerhouse Detroit Tigers play at Comericka Park in Detroit.   As the take in the game and cheer on their favorite players, anyone can see the fans’ pride in their team and their love of the game.  But, they are still holding out for that elusive World Series win!

Houston Astros,358,"Fans are hoping their 2008 season may be a chance at redemption for the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park.  Pinning their hopes on players such as catcher Brad Ausmus, right-handed pitcher Doug Brocail, third baseman Mike Costanzo, and center fielder Michael Bourn, baseball fanatics are hoping the Astros may put their less than stellar past seasons behind them and usher in a new era of baseball domination.","<p>The Houston Astros, one of Major League Baseball’s newer franchises, has earned a loyal fan base since it was created in the early 1960s.   On April 10, 1962, the newly formed Astros played their first professional game against the Chicago Cubs, defeating the team in an 11-4 victory.   In 1965, the Houston Astros moved to their new home, the Astrodome, making the Astros the first Major League Baseball team to play in a dome.  </p> 
<br/>
<p>
Through the 1960s and 1970s, the Astros did not make baseball history, with disappointing seasons and no pennant wins, their fans still turned up to watch their favorite team and players battle it out.  Finally, Astros’ fans’ patience paid off.   In the 1990s, the Houston Astros played their best seasons ever, thanks to star players like Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio. In 1997, the team managed to bring home their first ever National League Central title.  The following season, the team won an astounding 102 games and set records for attendance, with more than 2.45 million fans turning up to cheer on their team.  1999 would be another stellar season for the Astros, with the team winning 97 games.  1999 also marked the team’s last year at the Astrodome.  The following year, 2000, would see the team playing their inaugural game and Minute Maid Park, formerly Enron field.  2001 saw the team sharing the National League title with the St. Louis Cardinals.   Since then, though, the team has done little to write home about.   
</p>",
New York Mets,605,"Though the last seven seasons have been disappointing for players and fans alike, the Mets still have a huge fan base that turns out in droves to watch the team play at Shea Stadium.  The 2008 season has been dedicated to Shea Stadium’s forty-five-year history, with the New York Mets players wearing commemorative patches on their jerseys celebrating the stadium’s long-standing history.  And besides honoring the stadium, the team is hoping new blood and a better pitching staff may lead the team to another winning seasons.   Either way, New York Mets games at Shea Stadium and at other ballparks around the country are sure to be a hot ticket in 2008!  ","<p>The New York Mets came to be in 1959, when New York attorney William Shea announced the team would be created as one of the first to play for the newly created Continental League.  The Mets played their first game in 1961 and had an auspicious first season, setting their first, and probably most embarrassing Major League Baseball record, becoming the first major league team to lose 120.  To this day, that record has still not been broken, much to the team’s disappointment.  In their first four seasons, the team posted an astonishing 452 defeats.  </p>  
<br/>
<p>
Luckily for the New York Mets, and their fans, the team managed to turn their performance around and, in the 1966 season, thanks in large part to a well-built pitching staff, the team began winning more than losing.   In 1969, the Mets pulled out what many still consider to be their greatest season ever, winning one hundred games.  1973 brought the New York Mets their first National League championship, but they were upset by the Oakland As in the final game of the World Series.  </p> 
<br/>
<p>
For the next ten years, the Mets delivered less than stellar performances, with no notable winning streaks or records.   That all changed when Davey Johnson took over as the team’s manager in 1983.  With his draft picks of Darryl Strawberry, Hubie Brooks, Wally Backman, Kevin Mitchell, Dwight Gooden, Ron Darling, Johnson was able to put together a winning team that took the nation by storm.  In 1986, the Mets won the division title, beating the Astros and battling the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, where they won the Series title. </p>  
<br/>
<p>
The Mets wouldn’t return to post-season play until 1999, when they won the wild card spot for the division playoffs, but in the end, they lost the pennant to the Braves.  And, in 2000, the team went all the way to the World Series, making it the first Subway Series in almost forty-five years!  However, the defending Yankees managed to take the World Series title home, leaving the Mets defeated once again.

San Francisco Giants,759,"Fans are hoping the 2008 season will be better than 2007, when the team finished a dismal last in their division.   But, one thing is certain, fans will still be buying tickets for San Francisco Giant games at AT&T Park and a baseball venues around the country to watch as their team tries to battle its way back on top and show their true potential.","<p>The San Francisco Giants, previously the New York Gothams, arrived in San Francisco in 1958 to much fan fare and their new fans welcomed them to the city with much fanfare. When they moved into their new home in Candlestick Park, the team knew they were in California to stay! </p>
<br/>
<p>
In 1961, Willie Mays made team history by hitting four home runs in just one game.  Mays would go on to become one of the greatest Major League Baseball players of the era, and, in 1962, would help the team beat the favored Los Angeles Dodgers and advance to the team’s first World Series.   They would ultimately lose to the famed New York Yankees, setting the tone for the remainder of the decade, during which the team put out a less than stellar performance.</p>
<br/>
<p>
But, in 1971, the team made a dramatic comeback and fans with tickets to San Francisco Giants tickets were on hand to watch their team as they won their first division title.</p>
<br/>
<p>
During the 1980s, the only memorable event in San Francisco Giants history was the naming of Frank Robinson as General Manager in 1981.   Robinson was the first African-American manager in National League history.  The years from 1980 to 1987 were some of the worst in the team’s history, disappointing fans and players alike, until, in 1987, the team managed to pull out another division championship.   1989 brought another shot at a World Series win for the Giants, their first in thirty years.  Although the team was unable to win the title, fans hoped the Series would signal a change in fortune for the San Francisco Giants.   The addition of famed player Barry Bonds in 1992 further encouraged fans, but their hopes were trampled by a series of injuries and major losses.</p> 
<br/>
<p>
In 2001, Barry Bonds made baseball history by smashing through Mark McGwire’s home run record, hitting 73 runs in just one season.  Thanks in large part to Bonds’ skill as a hitter, the New York Giants were able to bring home their division title in 2000 and 2003.  They were National League champs in 2002, but ultimately lost to the California Angels.

Washington Nationals,560,"The Washington Nationals will soon move to the brand new Nationals Stadium in southeast Washington D.C., slated to open in April, 2008.   Owners and players alike are hoping the new stadium with draw in more fans and help MLB fans sit up and take notice of the team, despite their less-than-notable performance since their arrival in the nation’s capital.  As the 2008 season gears up, the team is hoping the addition of Lastings Milledge and Tyler Clipp will breathe new life into the team and help them move higher in the League standings.","<p>The Washinton Nationals originated in Montreal, Quebec in 1969 as the Montreal Expos.  After lackluster performances in Canada, the team moved to Washington, D.C. in 2005, where they become the Washington Nationals.  The Nationals move was the first complete relocation in Major League Baseball since 1972, when the Washington Senators deserted Washington, D.C. to become the Texas Rangers.</p>
<br/>
<p>
Despite the fact that the Nationals are one of only four Major League Baseball teams to never win a league championship and earn the chance to play in the World Series, fans were hoping the team’s move might signify a fresh start and a chance to rebuild the team and increase its fan base.  But, the Nationals’ move was hotly contested by Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who feared his team, which had been the only Major League Baseball franchise in the Baltimore/Washington region, would take a financial hit if the Nationals began to move in on his fan base.   The two teams managed to strike a deal that would protect the Orioles’ finances in 2005 and the Nationals began their run as the D.C. baseball team.</p>
<br/>
<p>
The Washington Nationals’ first game took place on April 4, 2005, at Citizens Ballpark against the Philadelphia Phillies.  The Nationals lost the game, 8-4, but, to those watching the game, it was obvious that baseball had arrived in D.C. and it was here to stay!   They played their first official home game on April 14 at RFK Stadium against the Arizona Diamondbacks, with President George W. Bush throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. 
</p>",
St. Louis Cardinals,807,"As the St. Louis Cardinals prepare for the 2008 season, fans with tickets to St. Louis Cardinals games at Busch Stadium and other baseball venues across the country are hoping their team will once again pull out a World Series win, defending their title as one of Major League Baseball’s greatest teams. ","<p>The St. Louis Cardinals, originally known as the St. Louis Browns, were formed as part of the American Association in 1882.  When the American Association folded just a few short years later, the St. Louis Cardinals became part of the National League, where they were called the St. Louis Perfectos.   Finally, in 1900, the team became the St. Louis Cardinals, as they are still known today.</p>
<br/>
<p>
The Cardinals soon had a strong following as the team won four American Association pennants in a row from 1885 to 1888. Fans showed up to St. Louis Cardinals games across the country to cheer on their favorite players and watch baseball history being made.  The St. Louis Cardinals won their first World Series title in 1886, and are now the second most successful team in Major League Baseball history, winning ten World Series titles, second only to the New York Yankees twenty-six Series wins.</p>
<br/>
<p>
After moving to the National League in 1892, the team found little success for the next thirty years, until, in 1920, general manager Branch Rickey began to use the minor league farm system to train players and began turning out some of baseball’s greatest players.  In 1926, the Cardinals would go on to win the World Series, beating out the favored New York Yankees.  The two teams would face off again in the 1928 World Series, with the Yankees avenging their earlier loss.</p>
<br/><p>
The St. Louis Cardinals won back-to-back pennants in 1930 and 1931, and managed to win the Series in 1931.  1934 brought the team another pennant and the World Series, against the Detroit Tigers.  In 1942, the St. Louis Cardinals would go on to make Major League Baseball history by winning a franchise record 106 games and beating out the Yankees again in the World Series.  The 1944 World Series was a first for the team as they battled their cross-town rivals, the St. Louis Browns, eventually winning their fifth World Series title.  In 1946, the team beat out the Boston Red Sox for another Series title, finishing out their winning streak until the 1964 season, when they would again return to the World Series and once again beat the New York Yankees. With the help of powerhouse pitcher Bob Gibson, the St. Louis Cardinals once again headed to the World Series, but lost out to the Detroit Tigers.  This would be the last time the St. Louis Cardinals advanced to the World Series for ten years.</p>
<br/>
<p>
The 1980s had the St. Louis Cardinals returning to their powerhouse ways, with the team reaching the World Series in 1982, 1985, and 1987.  After the 1987 series, the Cardinals fell out of the limelight, until the 1998, when slugger Mark McGwire broke the single series homerun record, hitting seventy home runs, battling against Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa to be the first player to break the previous record.</p>
<br/>
<p>
The first seven years of the twentieth century were a huge success for the St. Louis Cardinals, with the team winning the National League Central title six out of seven seasons, although they did not make it back to the World Series until 2004, when they were trounced by the Boston Red Sox.  In 2006 the St. Louis Cardinals were finally able to pull off the World Series win, beating the favored Detroit Tigers for the coveted title.</p>",
Philadelphia Phillies,672,"As the 2008 season begins, fans with tickets to Philadelphia Phillies games at Veterans Stadium are hoping the team will continue to improve, following their 2006 and 2007 third place finishes with even higher rankings, and maybe even winning that elusive World Series title again!","<p>The Philadelphia Phillies joined the National League in 1883 and immediately disappointed those hoping for a strong showing, losing 81 of 98 games in their first season.  Fans were not encouraged over the next few years, as the Philadelphia Phillies put for a disappointing effort for the remainder of the nineteenth century, and well into the twentieth.</p>
<br/>
<p>
Although Philadelphia Phillies games were largely efforts in futility as the team lost game after game, some of baseball’s greatest players played for the Phillies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including outfielder Sam Thompson, Billy Hamilton, Big Ed Delahanty, and Elmer Flick.</p>
<br/>
<p>
From 1919 to 1947, the Philadelphia Phillies came in last in the league an amazing twenty-four out of twenty-nine seasons!   Although many fans gave up on the team, die hard Philadelphia Phillies fans still bought tickets for Philadelphia Phillies games, hoping to be there to witness their turnaround.  In 1950, their patience finally paid off when the Philadelphia Phillies finally won a pennant and advanced to the World Series.  Although the Phillies lost to the powerful New York Yankees, it seemed the team was finally starting to find their groove.</p>
<br/>
<p>
The 1970s were the Phillies’ greatest decade.   They managed to win the National League title in 1976, 1977, and 1978, although the World Series title was still out of reach, until 1980, when the Philadelphia Phillies finally won their first title against the Royals.  In 1983, thanks in large part to players Pete Rose, Tug McGraw, Steve Carlton, and Joe Morgan, the Philadelphia Phillies once again headed to the World Series, where the team faced off, and lost to, the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
<br/>
<p>
After the 1983 Series, the Philadelphia Phillies went into a time of transition, losing key players and struggling to build a stronger team.  In 1993, the team won their fifth National League title, but once again were beat out in the World Series.  </p>",
Toronto Blue Jays,877,"As the 2008 season approaches, the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to improve on their 2007 third place finish.  With the help of pitcher A.J. Burnett, outfielder Matt Stairs, and left-hander David Purcey, the team may have a shot at the division title again and are sure to impress fans with their drive to rebuild their team and prove to the fans that the Toronto Blue Jays are still worth cheering for!","<p>The Toronto Blue Jays joined the Eastern Division of the American League as an expansion team in 1977.  Since the Montreal Expos’ 2004 move to Washinton D.C., the Blue Jays are now the only Major League Baseball team based in Canada.   The Blue Jays are also the only Canadian team to ever win a World Series.  Although fans were eager to take in Toronto Blue Jay games, the team had a disappointing showing their first season, finishing last in their division and winning only fifty-four games that year.  They continued their losing streak for the next few years, disappointing fans across Canada and the United States with their lackluster performance.  1982 was the first year the Toronto Blue Jays managed to pull themselves out of last place.</p>
<br/>
<p>
1983 saw the team improving, along with fans’ excitement for the team, as they finished in fourth place.  The winning trend continued in 1984, when the team finished a respectable second place.  And 1985 had the Toronto Blue Jays winning the first of five American League East division titles.</p>
<br/>
 <p>
The team experienced highs and lows over the next few years, but was still unable to pull out a ticket to the World Series, until 1992, when the Toronto Blue Jays finally won themselves a chance at the World Series and faced off against Atlanta Braves.  In an exciting series that came down to the eleventh inning in the final game, the Toronto Blue Jays became the first Canadian team in history to win the World Series.   They would repeat the feat in 1993, beating the Philadelphia Phillies for their second, and last, World Series win.  After their stunning 1993 World Series win, the Blue Jays were plagued by mediocre performances, losing streaks, and less than stellar rankings.  But, fans remained loyal, attending Toronto Blue Jays games at Rogers Centre, formerly as the Skydome, hoping their team’s record would improve and they might get a chance to watch the team bring the World Series title back to Canada once again.</p>",Images/toronto_blue_jays_tickets.jpg
Dallas Cowboys,214,,"<p>The Dallas Cowboys franchise is the most successful in the history of the National Football League.

<br/>
<p>Dallas was granted their NFL franchise on January 28th, 1960. They are based in the Dallas suburb of Irving, Texas. The team currently plays their home games at Texas Stadium in Irving, but they are scheduled to move to a new stadium in nearby Arlington in 2009.</p><br/>

In the initial months following their formation, the Dallas team was known as the “Steers.” They soon changed their name to the Cowboys prior to the start of the 1960 season.  </p>",

Tampa Bay Bucs,839,"The Tampa Bay Buccaneers sailed into the NFL in 1976, bringing professional football to the Bay area and the rowdy team of players into the hearts of area fans.  Although the Buccaneers were started as an NFL expansion team with few benefits and perks for players, coaches, and fans, the team was determined to prove their worth.  Despite their best efforts, fans at Tampa Bay Buccaneers games were sorely disappointed in the team’s first season, as they lost their first twenty-six games.  Their disappointing record continued for the team’s first three years as Tampa Bay Buccaneers ticket holders watched their team struggle to get their feet under them and overcome rookie mistakes and dismal playing.   Finally, in 1979, thanks in large part to the help of quarterback Doug Williams, the Buccaneers rallied, pulling of a surprising five-game winning streak in their first weeks of play.   Although they missed their chance at the playoffs, the team managed to pull off a 10-6 record for the 1979 season, giving fans at Tampa Bay Buccaneers games hope that their team might be made of the right stuff to succeed in the NFL.","<p>The team continued to play well for the next three years, finishing their 1982 season eligible for the playoffs, which they eventually lost to the Dallas Cowboys.  With the loss of quarterback Doug Williams just before the 1983 season, the Buccaneers seemed to fall apart, with lackluster performances making the team one of the worst in the league for the rest of the 1980s, and most of the 1990s. </p><br/>
<p>Finally, after the appointment of new head coach Tony Dungy in 1996, Tampa Bay Buccaneers games once again gave ticket holders something to cheer about.  As Dungy restored order to the team and introduced his innovative defense strategies, the Buccaneers began winning games, giving fans hope that their chance at a Super Bowl win might be in the near future.  </p><br/>

Phil Eagles,669,"The Philadelphia Eagles may not be the most illustrious team in the NFL, but loyal fans are hanging onto their tickets and pinning their hopes on the team’s recent successes while praying for a winning 2008 season. ","<p>The Philadelphia Eagles were formed in 1933 after the Frankford Yellow Jackets went bankrupt, leaving the city searching for a new NFL franchise.  On October 15, 1933, the team played its first game, facing off against the New York Giants.  The Eagles lost the game, which became a frequent site for fans throughout the team’s first decade.  But, after the disappointments of the 1930s, the 1940s brought a welcome change, with three Eastern division crowns from 1947 to 1948 and consecutive league titles in 1948 and 1949.  </p><br/>
<p>But despite their successes in the 1940s, the change of decades brought a change of fortunes in the 1950s and the team struggled to remain at the top of the NFL standings, until 1959 when the Eagles were ranked second in the NFL.  The 1960s saw much of the same as the team fought losing battles both on the field and off, with the team hitting rock bottom in 1969 when the team was forced to declare bankruptcy.  All the rowdy Philadelphia fans could do was hope the 1970s would bring another change of fate, this time for the better.  </p><br/>
<p>Despite their move to the brand-new Veteran’s Stadium in 1971, the team spent most of the decade mired in mediocrity.   Finally, in 1979 the Philadelphia Eagles was tied for first place, and finally in 1980, the team made it to Super Bowl XV, where they faced off against the Oakland Raiders, ultimately losing the game.  </p><br/>
<p>For the next two decades, Philadelphia Eagles games continued to disappoint fans, with less-than-stellar standings and performances from the team’s players and few notable moments.  </p><br/>
<p>In 2003 the Philadelphia Eagles began playing their games at Lincoln Financial Field, which seemed to signal a new era for the Eagles as they made it all the way to the conference championship despite losing the first two games of the season.   From 2001 to 2005, the Philadelphia Eagles reached their fourth consecutive championship game, an impressive record, even if the team failed to win the Super Bowl crown.  </p><br/>
<p>After a fourth place finish in the 2007 standing, the Philadelphia Eagles, and their impatient fans, are hoping the team will make it all the way to the Super Bowl and finally bring home a win, making the team’s struggles finally seem worth it.  </p>",

However, that New Orleans laissez faire attitude may have done the team in, as it would be more than two decades before fans at New Orleans Saints games could cheer their team to a winning season.  
The Saints first playoff win would not come until 2000, when the team managed to beat out the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams during their first foray into the world of post-season play.  But, despite their best efforts, the New Orleans Saints hold the dubious honor of being one out of only six NFL teams to never play in the Super Bowl.","<p>Still, the Saints have managed to build a strong following despite their seeming lack of strong talent and definite lack of winning seasons.  Games at the Louisiana Superdome are always filled with rowdy fans, hoping that this will be the game their team rise to greatness.  When Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans and its people in 2005, the Superdome sustained serious damage, both from the hurricane and the thousands of people who crowded into the dome searching for shelter from the storm.  The New Orleans Saints were forced to play their home games at various stadiums across the country, including Giants Stadium in New York, LSU’s Tiger Stadium in Baton Rogue, and the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas.   When the New Orleans Saints were able to return to the newly renovated Superdome for its 2006 home opener on September 25, 2006, New Orleans Saints fans were joined by football fans across the country as they stood up and cheered for their team’s triumphant return to the city of New Orleans, which was still struggling to rebuild after the devastating hurricanes of 2005.  The Saints did not disappoint their fans, beating out the Atlanta Falcons 23-3.  The game won a 2007 Espy award for “Best Moment in Sports”, proving the New Orleans Saints spirit and determination cannot be beat.

Green Bay Packers,339,"Tickets for Green Bay Packers’ games at Wisconsin’s famed Lambeau Field are a hot commodity for the team’s die-hard fans.   Thanks to Wisconsin’s legendarily brutal winters, fans are forced to endure arctic temperatures, brutal winds, and icy storms.  But, for Packer fans, the sacrifice is worth it. ","<p>Since the team was created in 1919, the Green Bay Packers have been a prominent fixture in NFL history.  The Packers, named for the Indian Packing Company, which supplied the team’s original jerseys, started their NFL tenure with a bang, winning ten games and losing only one in their first season.  Although they have had their ups and downs, the Green Bay Packers are still one of the most successful teams in NFL history, winning a record twelve championships over the last eighty years.  </p><br/>
<p>The success of the Green Bay Packers is due in large part to its strong coaching history.  Head coach and cofounder Curly Lambeau led the team to six championships from 1929 to 1944, creating a legacy of strength and success that the Green Bay Packers has maintained until now.  After Lambeau left the team in 1949 their success dwindled until Vince Lombardi took over the team in the 1960s and created a football dynasty that has never been topped.  Lombardi drafted some of the greatest names in NFL history for the Packers, and Green Bay Packers games became a huge draw as fans cheered the team on and watched them make history.  In his nine seasons as Green Bay Packers head coach, Lombardi helped the team win seventy-five percent of the games they played.  </p><br/>
<p>As the 2008 season approaches, Green Bay Packers fans are mourning the loss of quarterback Brett Farve, who retired after sixteen years with the team.

Chicago Bears,159,"Chicago Bears fans, grab your tickets, paint your chest blue, fire up the mini-grill for tailgating, and get ready for game day!   As the 2008 football season gets under way, the Chicago Bears are hoping to repeat their winning season from 2006 and make it back to the Super Bowl.","<p>Ranked only behind the Green Bay Packers in overall league play, the Chicago Bears have one of the largest fan bases in NFL history.   The team dominated professional football in the 1930s and 1940s, thanks in large part to the efforts of NFL cofounder George Halas.  Halas was hired by the NFL to organize and coach the Chicago Bears when the team was started in 1920.  He quickly created a team that became one of the most popular and powerful in the NFL, collecting 324 victories during his thirty seasons as the Bears’ head coach. </p><br/>
<p>Although the team has only won one Super Bowl title, in 1989, the Bears have won numerous league championships and become part of NFL history.  </p><br/>
<p>Originally, Chicago Bears’ games were played at Chicago’s Cubs Park, now known as the famous Wrigley Field.  The team was moved to Soldier Field on September 19, 1971, and have continued to play in the famed stadium ever since.  Tickets to Chicago Bears games at Soldier Field are a hot commodity as fans arrive to cheer on their favorite team.</p><br/>
<p>The 2008 Chicago Bears season is certain to be a nail biter, with fans hoping for a repeat of the 2006 season, when the Bears made it all the way to the Super Bowl, only to be defeated by the Indianapolis Colts.  Although the Bears lost, fans and critics believe the team may have what it takes to pull out a Super Bowl win.  With a little luck, quarterback Rex Grossman will be able to stay off the disabled list and lead the team to victory.  Running back Cedric Benson, line backer Brian Urlacher, kicker Robbie Gould, and the rest of the 2008 Chicago Bears roster are sure to give fans the wins they are hoping for and maybe even lead the team to their second Super Bowl title.  </p>",

Since its creation in 1898, the Arizona Cardinals have boasted a colorful history, filled with numerous ups and downs, triumphs and tragedies.  Although the Cardinals have resided in Arizona since 1988, they called Chicago, St. Louis, and Racine home throughout their 106-year history.  Now, the University of Phoenix Stadium hosts the Arizona Cardinals and their fans.  The stadium has been rated one of the top NFL venues in the country, and Cardinals fans know that’s true!  </p><br/>
<p>The 1920s, 1940s, and 1970s were banner decades for the Arizona Cardinals, with the team winning two NFL titles and four division championships, making them one of the strongest tips in the NFL.  However, the team has never played in a Super Bowl game and fans, players, coaches, and owners are eagerly awaiting their chance to win the big title.  Could the 2008 season give the team that chance? </p><br/>
<p>With Super Bowl XLII being held at the University of Phoenix Stadium, the Arizona Cardinals are hoping this will be their year to make it all the way.  2007 was Ken Whisenhunt’s first year as the Cardinals head coach, and he led the team to a 8-8 record, their best in ten years.  With the motivation of home field advantage, the new tactics of Whisenhunt, and the drive of new draft picks, the Arizona Cardinals are sure to give ticket holders something to cheer about on game days this year as they keep their fingers crossed and hope the Cards can make NFL history once more.  </p>"

Although the team has suffered a blow with offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden's retirement, the front office is very pleased with the draft picks, including quarterback Joe Flacco, running back Ray Rice, receiver Marcus Smith, and a handful of special teams players. Fans can bet Harbaugh will be working to bring his offense up to the level of his dynamic defense which, despite 2007's 5-11 record, ranked second in the NFL.  Ticket holders will be lucky to witness what promises to be a historic thirteenth season for the Ravens.","<p>The Baltimore Ravens, formerly the Cleveland Browns, played their first
season in Memorial Stadium in 1996 after a legal agreement that allowed
owner Art Modell to relocate and rename the team.  With Ted Marchibroda on board as head coach, the Ravens, whose name honors American poet Edgar Allan Poe who lived and is buried in Baltimore, ended the year with an unimpressive 4-12 record. When the following two seasons showed little improvement, Marchibroda was replaced by Brian Billick, who along with new quarterback Tony Banks urged the Ravens to an 8-8 record.  The big change came in 2000 when the Ravens, carried by a mighty defense, reached the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and went on to win Super Bowl XXXV in a 34-7 rout against the New York Giants. Another quarterback change in 2001 helped the team earn a wild card berth in the playoffs. Modell sold the team to local businessman Steve Bisciotti in 2003, a year that also saw the Ravens win their first ever AFC North division title. Although the team failed to reach the playoffs in 2004 and 2005, they racked up a franchise-best 13-3 season in 2006 to score another AFC North title. Billick ended his ninth and final season with the Ravens in 2006, going out on a bittersweet note in which a final game win against the Pittsburgh Steelers snapped what would have been a franchise-worst losing streak. John Harbaugh, named head coach in January 2008, is expected to bring the Ravens back into contention.</p>"

Lewis, heading into his sixth season as head coach, posted his first losing season with the Bengals in 2007 and has made it clear he will not accept a repeat. Lewis is confident the Bengals have all the talent they need to be winners. If players stick to the plan to run the ball and stop the run, ticket holders can expect to see some exciting, physical play as they watch the Bengals work through a tough schedule that pits them against 2007's eight top ten defenses, and six top ten rushing teams.","<p>The Cincinnati Bengals franchise was granted to owner/coach Paul Brown in 1968 as a member of the American Football Conference, which merged in 1970 with the NFL.  He went on to coach the first eight seasons before hiring Bill ""Tiger"""" Johnson as head coach in 1975 and handing over the management reins to his son Mike, although he remained involved in daily operations.  The Bengals reached the playoffs three times in the 1970s, and made it all the way to the Super Bowl twice in the 1980s. Brown's death in 1990 cast a pall over the team which subsequently struggled through fourteen consecutive non-winning seasons, even after moving to new headquarters at Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Things started looking up when Marvin Lewis was hired as head coach in 2003, the season that also marked the arrival of rookie quarterback Carson Palmer.

Reliant Stadium, one of the few arenas with a retractable roof, was completed in time to host the Texans' first game which the team won 19-10 against the Dallas Cowboys, making them the second expansion team ever to win its first game. The remainder of the season did not go quite as well, ending with a 4-12 record.  While the Texans were given a pass in their first three years, by the fourth season fans were getting impatient for their team to show some serious progress.

Bill Parcells, the newly installed executive vice president of football operations, along with general manager Jeff Ireland, and head coach Tony Sparano are confident the 2008 season will mark the turning point at which the Dolphins regain their former glory. Loyal and returning fans will not want to miss one minute of the action.</p>"
Tennessee Titans,848,"Die-hard fans of the Tennessee Titans will want to have tickets in hand when their team hits Nashville's LP Field looking for another Music City Miracle in the 2008-09 season. In his end-of-season remarks head coach Jeff Fisher said his strategy for turning his young team into winners will depend on upgrading the roster and upgrading the players already on the roster. Quarterback Vince Young, who had a good showing last season as the youngest quarterback in the franchise's twenty-four year history to start a playoff game, will be back, along with a pair of defensive ends, a wide receiver, running back, and other players added during the April draft. Mike Reinfeldt will also be taking up the reins as Executive Vice President/General Manager following the resignation of Floyd Reese after thirteen years. Tickets to the Tennessee Titan's games will be an especially hot commodity as fans will not want to miss the fledgling team's push toward the playoffs and another run at the Super Bowl.","<p>The 2008-09 season marks the tenth year of play for the Tennessee Titans which began as a charter member of the American Football League as the Houston Oilers in 1960. Bud Adams, one of eight original AFL owners, relocated the team to Tennessee in 1997, and after playing two seasons as the Tennessee Oilers changed the name in 1999 at the same time as the team relocated from Memphis to Nashville''s Adelphia Coliseum, now known as LP Field. The 1999 season stands at 13-3 as the best in the franchise's history, and is known for the 75-yard pass return, dubbed the Music City Miracle, that won the playoff game against the Buffalo Bills in the last sixteen seconds, sending the Titans to Super Bowl XXXIV.  The team has suffered its ups and downs in the early years of the twenty-first century, but looks to be on an upswing with veteran coach Jeff Fisher optimistic about the future.</p>"
Washington Redskins,925,"As the team rebuilt its following, the fans followed, with tickets to Washington Redskins games at FedEx Field in Washington, D.C., consistently selling out and football fans showing up in droves at venues across the country to witness the Washington Redskins continue to make NFL history.","<p>The Washington Redskins may have originated as a Boston team in the early 1930s, but they solidified their place in NFL history with their move to Washington in 1937, where Washington Redskins’ games began to sell out as fans rejoiced in professional football’s arrival in the nation’s capital.  The team proved its worth early on in its professional football career, coming in second in their division just three seasons after the team was created.  Despite their early successes, the Redskins were plagued by short-lived head coaches, going through numerous coaches and considerable upheaval in their first decade as a professional football team.  But, ever-revolving head coaches could not stop the Washington Redskins from winning a spot in the 1937 NFL Championship game against the Chicago Bears and beating the Bears 28-21.  Just three short years later, the two teams would face off again in the 1940 Championship game, where the Bears humiliated the Redskins, winning 73-0.  The rivalry between the two teams came to a head again at the 1942 Championship game, where the Redskins won back their honor, as well as the championship title, 14-6.</p><br/>
<p>After their successes in the 1940s, Washington Redskins games became less exciting for fans as the team began a slow decline.  The Redskins saw only three winning seasons between 1946 and 1968.  In 1969, Vince Lombardi took over the team, helping to lead the Redskins to their best season since 1955, but, fans’ dreams of further seasons with Lombardi at the helm were dashed when he lost his battle with cancer in 1970.  Two years later, George Allen took over as head coach and helped the team begin to rebuild and work its way to the top of the NFL.  Over the next few years, the Redskins improved their strategies and began pulling in winning seasons once again.  1983 saw the Redskins bring home their first Super Bowl win, beating out the Miami Dolphins 27-17, and having a record-breaking season, losing only one game.   The team’s strong players lead them once again to the Super Bowl, which they eventually lost to the Raiders.  1992 brought the Washington Redskins another Super Bowl win.</p>"
New York Jets,601,"For the 2008 season, head coach Eric Mangini hopes to win even more fans and begin to consistently sell out tickets to New York Jets games by building a consistent team that will allow they to once again rise to the top of the NFL, and maybe even bring home another Super Bowl title.  With linebacker Vernon Gholston, Laveranues Coles, Thomas Jones, and Kellen Clemens, the Jets will have their work cut out for them as they battle for a winning season and prove to their fans the Jets have the ability to return to their glory days.","<p>The New York Jets, originally known as the New York Titans, jetted into NFL history in 1960, proving to cynical New York fans with tickets to the team’s first games that there was a new powerhouse in town.  With the arrival of Joe Namath in 1964, the New York Jets began a steady rise to the top of the NFL, with Namath leading the team to a winning record in 1967 and proving he was worthy of the team’s first draft pick.  In 1969, Namath led his team to the AFL Championship, and earned them a place in the NFL’s first Super Bowl.  Thanks in large part to Namath, the New York Jets went on to serve the Baltimore Colts one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history, with the undervalued Jets beating the Colts 16-7, proving the AFL was worthy of competing in the NFL.  </p><br/>
<p>1969 would prove to be Joe Namath, and the New York Jets’, most notable season.  With Namath plagued by injury and missing out on much of the 1970, 1971, and 1973 seasons due to serious knee injuries, the team began to suffer and slide into obscurity for the next few years, leaving other teams, including their cross-town rivals, the New York Giants, to rise to the top of the NFL and cause the Jets to the fade into obscurity thanks to disappointing seasons and player performances.  </p><br/>
<p>Although the New York Jets play in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, they are still hope to be the pride of the city, competing with the New York Giants, who also play at Giants Stadium, for the loyalty of New Yorkers. </p><br/>"
Denver Broncos,234,"As the Denver Broncos prepare for the 2008 football season, head coach Mike Shanahan and loyal fans are hoping the team can overcome its two-year absence from the AFC Championship and earn another Super Bowl win.   With Jay Cutler dealing with his recent Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis and receiver Brandon Marshall out of commission due to an accident that injured his arm, fans with season tickets to Denver Broncos games will be eagerly watching Selvin Young, Michael Pittman, rookie Ryan Torian, and Darrell Jackson to lead the Bronco to victory once more.","<p>Since their entrance into the NFL as an American Football League team in 1960, the Denver Broncos have proved to lucky ticket holders at Denver Broncos games that brute strength and sheer determination can help a team rise to the top of the NFL.  The team stampeded their way into NFL history by winning their very first game, defeating the Boston Patriots 13-10 on September 9, 1960.  </p><br/>
<p>Although the team would not have its first winning season until 1973, the Broncos still managed to prove themselves to loyal fans, and rise to the top of the NFL rankings.  With the hiring of rookie coach Red Miller, the Denver Broncos began a shocking turn around, advancing to their first playoff appearance in 1977 and making the first of six Super Bowl appearances.  The Broncos would lose to the Dallas Cowboys, 27-10, but the 1977 season signaled a turn around for the Broncos that would continue for the next six years. </p><br/>
<p>With the addition of quarterback John Elway in 1983, the Denver Broncos would continue to work their way to the top of the NFL, with Elway leading the team to five Super Bowl appearances, including Super Bowl XXXIII, where Elway would end his NFL career as Super Bowl MVP.  Although the team would not win the Super Bowl until 1997, where they beat the Green Bay Packers 31-24 in Super Bowl XXXII, the Denver Broncos would follow that Super Bowl win with another the following year, where they beat Atlanta Falcons 34-19 in Super Bowl XXXIII, becoming one of the few elite NFL teams to boast consecutive Super Bowl wins.  </p>"
Carolina Panthers,144,"Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, has been the Carolina Panthers’ home since the 1996 season, and Panthers tickets are a hot commodity in both North and South Carolina as fans watch the Panthers claw their way to victory.  Panthers games are a sure hit for NFL fans young and old, as the team offers fans a chance to watch NFL history be made.","<p>The Carolina Panthers came roaring into NFL history in their 1995 debut season, winning a record amount of games for an expansion team and proving that they were a team to be reckoned with, as season tickets for Carolina Panthers games quickly sold out to eager fans.   The Panthers were created in 1993, when NFL owners unanimously voted to make Carolina the 29th NFL franchise, and first expansion team to be added since 1976.  Carolina Panthers cofounder and owner Jerry Richardson also ensured his place in football history by becoming only the second former NFL player to become a team owner.</p><br/>
<p>Former defensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dom Capers, became the Panthers’ first head coach, with Rod Smith, Greg Kragen, Jack Trudeau, and Mark Carrier rounding out the team’s roster.  The team quickly proved to be a formidable opponent, winning their first game, beating the Jacksonville Jaguars 20-14 on July 29, 1995.  The Carolina Panthers’ first season continued on a high note, with the team winning four consecutive games, a record for any expansion team, and defeating the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers 13-7.  </p><br/>
<p>The Carolina Panthers showed fans attending games during their sophmore season that they had what it takes to be leauge championships, with another impressive record and the NFC West title under their belts, an impressive feat for such a young team.  </p><br/>
<p>Despite their triumphant start in the NFL, the Carolina Panthers found themselves stuck in a slump for the next six years, with unimpressive records, disappointing losses, and uninspired games for fans.  Personal tragedies, embarrasments, and mistakes began to plauge the Caronlina Panthers as the team lost key players to jail, injury, and personal conflicts.  The team replaced head coach Dom Capers with George Seifert after a disappointing 1998 season.  However, Seifert had no more luck with the team than Capers and was let go after only three seasons in Carolina.  John Fox became the team’s third head coach, and continues to lead the team today.   In 2003, Fox proved to be a good choice for head coach as he led the Panthers to their first Super Bowl appearance.  Although the Panthers failed to beat out the New England Patriots, fans were thrilled to see the young team finally proving the had what it takes to survive and thrive in the NFL.   
Fox would lead the Panthers into the playoffs in both the 2005 and 2007 seasons, but failed to win a chance for a Super Bowl repeat.  </p>"
Atlanta Falcons,51,Buy your Atlanta Falcons Football tickets today and watch the game live at the Georgia Dome.,"<p>The Atlanta Falcons managed to claw their way into fans’ hearts and Georgia history with their debut as an NFL franchise on June 30, 1965, with football fans eagerly lining up to score Atlanta Falcons tickets and watch a new team make NFL magic.  The team had a less than stellar beginning, losing their first game to the Philadelphia Eagles, and the next eight games after that.  The team’s first victory came against the New York Giants, but would prove to be only a brief high in a disappointing run.  The Falcons would only rack up a disappointing twelve wins throughout the 1960s.  Not the roaring start the team, and its fans, was hoping for.  </p><br/>
<p>Although the team finally produced a winning season in 1971, Atlanta Falcons games would prove to be disappointing for ticket holders, with the Falcons consistently landing in the bottom half of their division rankings.  Finally, in 1978, the Falcons won a wildcard spot into the playoffs, but eventually lost to the Dallas Cowboys.   The team would continue to disappoint its fans throughout the 1980s, with dismal records, poor playing, and little excitement for fans attending Atlanta Falcons games.  After a brief glimmer of hope in 1991, when the team once again made it to the playoffs but lost their chance at a Super Bowl spot, the Falcons continued to turn in lack luster performances, giving fans little to look forward too.  </p><br/>
<p>With no Super Bowl appearances, less than a handful of playoff spots, and unimpressive records, the Atlanta Falcons may not be the NFL’s best performing team, but fans continue to hope their team will produce a winning season, buying tickets for Atlanta Falcons games at the Georgia Dome, dreaming that this season may be the one to turn the tides and show that the Falcons can produce a winning season, despite their past records.   </p>"

<p>The Vikings became an official NFL franchise in the early 1960s, facing off against the Chicago Bears, with a 37-13 win that would be the start of a rivalry with the Bears that lives on today.  Norm Van Brocklin became the Vikings’ first head coach, and led the team for its first five years.  Van Brocklin helped build a strong team roster that would help the Vikings win their first playoff spot in 1968.  In 1969, Van Brocklin was replaced by Bud Grant, who led the team to a record-breaking twelve-game winning streak in the 1969 season and earned them their first Super Bowl slot.  </p><br/>
<p>The 1970s started out on a high note, with the Vikings producing winning seasons in 1970 and 1971, and made their second Super Bowl appearance in 1973.  Although they would lose to the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VIII, the Minnesota Vikings would have a chance at redemption in the 1974 season, playing in Super Bowl IX.  But, Super Bowl victory would still elude the team as they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 16-6. </p><br/>
<p>The team was hoping for a fourth Super Bowl appearance in 1975, but the dream was dashed when they lost to Dallas Cowboys in a controversial playoff game that saw irate Vikings fans throwing debris onto the field as they objected to a ref’s call.   1977 saw the Vikings once again in the playoffs, but lost to eventual Super Bowl XII champions, the Dallas Cowboys.  </p><br/>
<p>The 1980s saw the Minnesota Vikings moving from Metropolitan Stadium, with the Vikings defeating Tampa Bay at their inaugural game at the Metrodome on August 21, 1982.   The stadium move would prove to be the most exciting event in the ‘80s for the Vikings, with only two playoff appearances and no Super Bowl slots.  </p><br/>
<p>The 1990s proved to be disappointing for the Vikings, until their record-breaking 1998 season, which led to consecutive playoff appearances in ’98 and ’99 and ushered th enew millennium in on a high note which would continue through the 2000 season.   Although the Vikings would continue to put out strong performances through the next few years, they failed to make it to the Super Bowl, leaving fans hoping that this season might be the one that finally sees their team winning the Super Bowl title.

<p>The 49ers’ impressive Super Bowl record began in 1982, winning Super Bowl XVI by defeating the championship Cincinnati Bengals 26-21 on January 24th.  The 1982 win, as well as the 49ers’ Super Bowl XXIII win in 1989, again against the Cincinnati Bengals, were thanks in large part to legendary quarterback Joe Montana, who played with the 49ers for sixteen seasons and is still considered one of the NFL’s greatest quarterbacks of all time.  </p><br/>
<p>January 20, 1985, saw the San Francisco 49ers making their third Super Bowl appearance, facing off against the champion Miami Dolphins at Stanford Stadium.

A short four years later, the 49ers would once again win the Super Bowl in 1989.  The 49ers managed to pull off a repeat win the following season, beating out the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV 55-10, giving the 49ers one of the most lopsided wins in Super Bowl history.  1995 would mark the last time the 49ers made it to the Super Bowl to date, but also marks their fifth Super Bowl win, as the team trounced the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX.  </p>"

<p>1967 saw the Oakland Raiders making the first of five Super Bowl appearances after winning their first of twelve division championships.  Although the Raiders lost Super Bowl II to Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers, 33-14, the Raiders still proved they were a team to be reckoned with.

1946 when the team became a charter member of the All-American Football
Conference.  After winning four AAFC titles, including an undefeated season in 1948, the team joined the NFL and Paul Brown was named as vice-president, general manager, and head coach.  Although many believe the team was named for the coach, the official name, Brown Bombers, was selected in a public opinion contest in honor of heavyweight champion Joe Louis.  While not much was expected of the team in its first NFL season, the Browns proved their worth, reaching the title game for the next six years before experiencing their first losing season in 1956 after the retirement of quarterback Otto Graham. Art Modell purchased the Browns in 1961 and a power struggle ensued between him and head coach Paul Brown who was fired in 1962.  There followed a series of coaches who often led the team to winning seasons only to fall short in the playoffs. In 1990 the team really began to unravel, ending the season at 3-13, the second worst record in the league.  After a rash of quarterback problems in the early 90s, Modell announced plans in 1995 to move the Browns to Baltimore.  Fan protests and legal wrangling resulted in the team being deactivated for three years while a new stadium was built. Modell was granted a new franchise for Baltimore, and the Browns, sold to Al Lerner in 1998 as an expansion team, kept their name, history, records, awards, and archives in Cleveland.

Toward that end, he has made as few changes to personnel as possible, and with the exception of some much-needed tweaking to the offense, is dedicated to staying the course set when he came on board in 2006. After finishing 7-9 in the last two seasons, the Bills are absolutely ready for a return to the success they enjoyed in the 1990s.  Quarterback Trent Edwards, who achieved a team record for most touchdown passes in a game during his rookie year, along with his veteran teammates, will benefit from the addition of cornerback Leodis McKelvin, wide receiver James Hardy, and tight end Derek Fine to the roster.

In 1964 the Bills became the first AFL team to win thirteen games in a season on the strength of the defense. The team was assimilated into the NFL in 1970.  With Joe Ferguson as the new quarterback and running back O.J.

After dismal back-to-back seasons in 1983 and 1984, Marv Levy took over as head coach, and along with general manager Bill Polian revamped the team, resulting in the first of four consecutive winning seasons, each of which ended in Super Bowl losses. The retirement of quarterback Jim Kelly in 1996, followed by the departure of Levy the next year, marked the end of a successful era. The Buffalo Bills have had their struggles in the early years of the twenty-first century, including a quarterback controversy involving Doug Flutie and Rob Johnson, which ended when Flutie left, along with general manager John Butler in 2000.

Things did not start looking up until 1970 when the AFL was assimilated into the NFL.  Under head coach Chuck Noll, who came on board in 1969, the Steelers grew into one of the NFL's greatest dynasties--helped along by the coach's talent for drafting future Hall of Fame players, as well as a move to the state-of-the-art Heinz Stadium in 2001. After reaching the playoffs for eight seasons, including trips to the Super Bowl four times in six years, Noll's legendary players began to retire in the 1980s, leaving the Steelers to struggle until the early 1990s when Noll retired.

The team just needs to prove they have the strength and determination to finally win the ultimate title.  </p><br/>
<p>The team’s first and only Super Bowl appearance was at Super Bowl XXIX, on January 29, 1995.   The Chargers faced off against the NFC champion San Francisco 49ers at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, Florida.  The 49ers went on to defeat the Chargers, 49-26, but the valiant Chargers showed they were still a team to be reckoned with.  Fans’ hopes were high in 2007, when the San Diego Chargers made it all the way to the playoffs, but their ultimate defeat once again dashed the teams’ chances at winning their first Super Bowl title.

Have you purchased your Iron Maiden tickets yet?","<p>Before Steve Harris became a musician, he played for a youth team called ""The Irons"" which helped influence the name of the band.  Along with The Irons, the medieval torture device, an Iron Maiden also inspired the band's name.  When Steve Harris (bassist) and Dave Murray (guitarist) met up in 1970, Iron Maiden had a great line up at local punk rock shows in London.  Even after multiple replacements in the band, they had a big following only after three years of performing together. </p><br/>
<p>In 1980, Adrian Smith (guitar) replaced Dennis Stratton, turning Iron Maiden into one of legendary bands of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal after releasing the Iron Maiden album. The lyrics in the song ""Iron Maiden"" speak about the method of execution used in Germany.  After touring with Kiss and Judas Priest, Iron Maiden produced another album titled Killers with only two new tracks.  One of those being “Murders in the Rue Morgue”, an energetic song which only brought more lime light to this heavy metal band!</p><br/>

Dickinson’s debut was just in time for Iron Maiden’s classic heavy metal album The Number of the Beast. Including songs such as ""The Number of the Beast"", ""Run to the Hills"" and ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"".  This would be the first time the band went on a world tour.  Iron Maiden tickets sold in the United States, Japan and Australia.  From this point on, up until 1990, more replacements and more albums were produced.  Nicko McBrain (drummer) replaced Clive Burr and went on to release four more albums, Piece of Mind (1983), Powerslave (1984), Live After Death (1985) and Somewhere in Time (1986), making Iron Maiden multi-platinum worldwide!  After the release of No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, Dickinson ventured out on his own to pursue a solo album in 1993 and the band started suffered after trying to find even more replacements once.  However, by 1990, Iron Maiden announced the return of Dickinson, giving Iron Maiden three guitarists (Dickinson, Smith and Gers), which only lead to the road of success.  From this point on, Iron Maiden pulled together and have been rocking strong ever since which lead to more progressive rock albums such as, Brave New World (2000) and, Dance of Death (2003).</p><br/>
